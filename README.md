# Reporting
You can use this repository to report bugs, ask questions and suggest any ideas you might have.
> **NOTE:** Please fill out the forms correctly, and try to be as accurate as possible.
## Reporting Bugs & Suggestions
You can get started by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/Extrack-Stealer/report/issues/new/choose), and selecting what kind of issue you want to report.
## Labeling your issues correctly
Labeling is important, since we need to know what type of issue we are dealing with before getting to it.

### Type Labels
The `Bug` label should be used when you encounter an issue with Extrack that seems to be an inconvenience.

The `Suggestion` label should be used when you are submitting an idea or an enhancement.

The `Vulnerability` label should be used when an issue is service-breaking, for example: being able to access other people's collections.


### Priority Labels
> **NOTE:** This label will be readjusted when we get to reviewing the issue.
> If you are not sure which label to pick, don't put a label on it, althought it is appriciated if you do.

The `Very Low Priority` label should be used in contexts where the issue doesn't really matter, and shouldn't be actively worked on, for example: a small visual bug in the app.

The `Low Priority` label should be used in contexts where the issue does matter, but isn't urgent to work on it at all, for example: certain buttons don't work.

The `Medium Priority` label should be used in contexts where the issue might be breaking things locally, for example: a page doesn't render in certain events.

The `High Priority` label should be used in contexts where the issue might fatally break things locally, for example: the app instantly crashes when opening it in a certain environment.

The `Very High Priority` label should be used in contexts where the issue branches out to server-side, for example: you can edit objects you do not have access to.

### Environment Labels
The `Extrack App` label should be used when the issue originates from the app itself, for example: a visual bug.

The `Extrack Backend` label should be used when the issue originates from the backend, for example: not receiving any data in a request.

The `Extrack Builder` label should be used when the issue originates from the builder, for example: your .exe file does not build correctly.


### Developer Labels
> **NOTE:** When these labels are applied, we will probably close your issue.

The `Won't Fix` label will be placed on your issue when an issue is intentional, or due to software limitations, we cannot fix it.

The `Duplicate` label will be placed on your issue when another issue with the same description already exists.
